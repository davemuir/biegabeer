Watermark WP Image Protect is a dynamic watermarking plugin.

== Description ==

Watermark WP Image Protect allows you to watermark all the images on your site.  Unlike other watermarking techniques and plugins, the original images are unaffected and you **do not need to edit or re-upload the images**, it is done automatically for you.

Out of the box WP Image Protect has all these capabilities:

* Apply text watermarks to all of your site in seconds (new and existing uploads) 
* Set the text, font, colour, size and background of the  Watermark
* Specify threshold to apply watermarks (to exclude thumbnails as required)
* Exclude individual images from Watermarking with the media library
* Alter, reposition or remove all Watermarks in seconds through your WordPress administration panel
* **NEW in 2.5** Image Statistics (goto Media > Library)

Please raise any support queries on the support forum.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Are the original images affected by the watermarking process? =

A. No. One of the primary features of WP Image Protect Premium is that the original image remains unaffected by the watermarking process. The watermarks are only applied as they are viewed on your site.

= Q. There are no errors, but Watermarks are not being displayed =

A. Ensure the plugin is activated an you have selected the relevant option from Settings > WP Image Protect Settings in your WordPress administration dashboard.

If there are still problems try disabling all other plugins, reverting to the default theme and then re-enabling the plugins one-by-one to identify any conflicting plugins.

= Q. My images are not being displayed, even after deactivating the plugin =

A. This is a known issue with some configurations. To restore the images goto your WordPress administration panel, click on Settings > Permalinks and press Save.


= Q. There is another problem with the plugin =

A. Firstly, try de-activating other plugins.  If you have tried this and are still having issues please use the contact link (Premium only) or open a ticket on the WordPress.org support forum (Lite only), providing as much detail as possible - the version of WordPress and WP Image Protect you are using and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

= Q. Are my original images affected by Watermarking? =

A. No. The technology employed in WP Image Protect means that the Watermark is only displayed when the image is rendered.

= Q. How do I specify what images are Watermarked/Excluded from Watermarking? =

A. By default, watermarks are applied to all uploaded images above the 'Watermark only Size' threshold found on the plugin settings page. This ensures that smaller images such as thumbnails are not watermarked. Additionally, you can exclude individual images from the watermarking process by selecting the relevant image from Media > Library in your WordPress administration console and checking 'WPIPP Exclude from Watermarking' checkbox and pressing 'Update'
